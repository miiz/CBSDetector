# Code Bad Smells Detector

This is a Java Code Bad Smells Detector. It detects five Martin Martin Fowler's Code Bad Smells: Data Clumps, Message Chain, Middle Man, Speculative Generality, and Switch Statement from Java source code.
The detector itself is a Eclipse plug-in. The detection results can display in eclipse IDE or be exported as different formats, plain text, XML, Swing UI.
It is a part of my previous PHD research in University of Hertfordshire.
