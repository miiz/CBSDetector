# Code Bad Smells Detector

This is a Java Code Bad Smells Detector. 
It detects five Martin Fowler's Code Bad Smells: Data Clumps, Message Chain, Middle Man, Speculative Generality, and Switch Statement from Java source code. 
This project is an Eclipse plug-in. The detection results can display in eclipse IDE or be exported as different formats, plain text, XML, Swing UI. 
It is a part of my previous PHD research in University of Hertfordshire.
